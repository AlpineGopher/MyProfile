<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>
The Project Idea that I would like to create is an application that links a users’ phone or any other device that enters an Alpine Resorts area.  This links the user to a ‘Hub’ with the local Emergency Services the first point of call with the aid of flags for different criteria that the user has set up, along with flag you as the user can set up next of kin details for every class of incident that could arise.  If the user is a thrill seeker and likes to explore the back country, they can log it with the ‘Hub’ on details of their trip.  This app work off voice prompt and interactive methods to allow the user to make SOS calls for emergencies and non-emergencies depending on the situation.  The user can enable tracking, weather reports, lift status, webcam feeds, (if requested promotional popups, deals, general enquiry links) With this app activated will receive rewards for distance traveled each day, rewards such as discounted meals, ski hire, promotional draws.

My main motivation behind this idea is that just recently I had a mate of mine suddenly have a stroke with no warning signs.  He is very fit as he hikes and skis nearly every day, not stressed or anything so it was a big shock to the community up here.  I had spent a few weeks working on a project with him and I had called him the morning of the day he was found.  With strokes and heart attacks time is crucial for the recovery of someone.  This app is manly designed for guests who like to explore the backcountry with the emergency services in mind, but still has the benefits for anyone that is using the app around the village. With the unpredictable weather patterns of the world this app will aid the Emergency Services, as the app will upload GPS coordinates every 15 minutes.  An automated “R U OK” message will be sent out if the guest has remained stationary for a certain period of time which the user can allocate within a 60 minute time frame once the guest has left the patrolled boundary of the resort.

Whilst in the village the user can use it as a rewards app, to track your turns on the slopes with the app is working in the background as a sleep tracker so it can monitor the user in case of a stroke, heart attack, sudden jolt.  It can notify any other user that is nearby or has been nearby within the last 30 minutes for the first message then the device will redial the most recent call.  The recipient of the call can switch off the alert once the second user is prompted to call, by another user and if no response a flag is put up to the ‘Hub’ which can be turned off by the responding user to the emergencies.

This app also allows the user to have access to:

Weather reports with live updates set upon users' request.

Tracking enabled so that the user can log their speed, distance of travel, elevation, GPS uploads every 15 minutes.

Out of resort boundry automated message upon user specification under the allowance of 60 minutes, if not responded the appropriate emergency service will be notified for them to decide what is needed to be done.

Body Shock feature, where the device that is enabled will send an automated message sent to the user's desired contact if the device receives a sudden shock.  The app will send out a message containing the GPS location, time and how hard the impact was.  It will send out a message to the ‘Hub’ and the contact the user entered, who can lower the flag if false alarm.

Help button depending on assistance required. (Always contact emergency services)

Guest chat for general enquires.

Restaurant booking.

Accomodation bookings.

Rewards for distance traveled, places explored and other promotional rewards.  These rewards include discounted products and services in and around the resort.

The app will send information back to a hub that will have algorithms set and the desired contact details of the user.  I hold a high interest in this app as I am in the SES and the CFA up here and any assistance to make the situation easier could save someone's life, time is essential for the rate of survival of the individual.

The software that is needed for this app are Shock sensitivity, location properties, call and message functions.  The ability to communicate with satellites to pin devices and other devices.

I plan to establish this app through the aid of a Raspberry PI, but that will come down to a lot of trial and error.  This project is designed for the aid of emergency services to gain access to anyone that is closer to the user's location so that they can have a quick response time in the case of an emergency.

As guests have gotten lost over the years from exploring or get trapped in weather systems, and where time can mean the difference of life or death this app could certainly help future instances and If this app was around for Alpine Resorts, we could make modifications to set it for other high-risk activities.

If this app was to succeed, the impact would be a massive impact for the Emergency Services in assisting the first responder's response time to find the location of the individual.  They will have a distinct GPS trail of where they have been in case, they have just lost their device or dropped it suddenly.  Another benefit is that emergency responders can triage from the ‘Hub’ in case there may be another incident or other delays.  There will be a lot of troubleshooting different methods to achieve an app that could do this and not impede on the user's privacy, but with the way the world is moving forward in the technology sector, there are apps similar to this idea.  There is always a way for improvement.
