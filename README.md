<h1>Interests in IT.</h1>  

 My interest in the IT world started when I was around 8 years old, where I was playing around circuit boards with my father.  From there my father bought our first TV and games console (commodore 64) which intrigued me.  Around when I was 12, I would go to the local library as I wasn’t allowed to go anywhere else, in result I made friends and they were into software design (they were in their 20’s).  During this friendship they would teach me certain this they were working on, also the library would hold classes to lean web page design, computer graphics and animations.  Over the year's things happened and now I have an opportunity with the currant worlds situation to pursue down the IT path through the aid of RMIT.  Currently I am rolling out layer 1 fiber optics , from digging in the infrastructure, splicing, and security cameras I would like to do more, so this is my reason for enrolling with RMIT.  Through RMIT I hope to gain knowledge that can assist me to progress my career, I am also enrolled in Programing.
